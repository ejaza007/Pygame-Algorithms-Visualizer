# Pygame-Algorithms-Visualizer
This Algorithm visualiser is built using Python and Pygame. It also has a total runtime graph of all algorithms plotted on a line graph for comparison.

## Algorithms
* Merge Sort
* Quicksort
* Insertion Sort
* Heap Sort
* Count sort
* Bubble Sort
* Bucket Sort
* Radix Sort

## Usage
The directory contains 3 separate files containing random numbers of varrying lengths:
  * Small   (10 numbers)
  * Medium  (10,000 numbers)
  * High    (1,000,000 numbers)
Upon running the program, the user can select their desired file to choose the numbers from and their desired algorithm using letters on the keyboard. For simplicity's sake, I have only rendered 170 numbers on screen. When calculating the time, all of the numbers inside a chosen file are used.
